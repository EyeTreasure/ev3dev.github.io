Most HTML will work too.

Here are some suggestions for what to include in your description:

- **Berend Rah** Who are you?
- **Location:** Where do you live? At least, which country. City would be nice too.
- **Pictures and media:** If you don't have any video, do you have pictures? Or maybe a PDF detailing what you built?
- **Feedback:** Is there a place that people can leave comments or ask questions? Maybe on your GitHub repo or on your blog?
